# COM3550 Undergraduate Ambassadors Scheme for Computer Science

This is the source for the work I submitted as part of this module. As with most of my written work, it's compiled from Markdown using `pandoc`.

The reports discuss work I did (and planned to do, in spite of COVID-19) as part of the module. I was tasked with assisting teaching of computer science in a local school, including running a special project of my choosing to meet a research conclusion.

To briefly summarise these reports, I was able to make seven visits and support various lessons, from Year 7 to Year 12. I prepared an exercise in Python for the Year 12 students as an introduction to version control and test-driven development. This, unfortunately, couldn't be carried out.

I received a mark of 74% for this work.

Use `scripts/compile` to compile the reports.
