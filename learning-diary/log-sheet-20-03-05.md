# COM3550: Weekly Log Sheet

**Student Name:** Simon Fish

**Date:** 05-03-2020

**Action points identified from previous visit:** 

**Tutoring context and session content:**

- Taught Y12 class on fixed-point decimals - demonstrated concept using powers
  of 2
- First time, got a little bit nervous, but got good feedback from Nick - says I did a good job - not far off building confidence in the class
- Developed converter in Excel on the fly to help with giving out answers

**Achievement and Progress:**   
*With reference to the Learning Criteria (1 to 6)
outlined in Section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have
taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the
methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or
need for improvement. Continue on a second sheet if required.*

**(1) Communication:**   
I was somewhat nervous when presenting the concept of fixed-point decimals. I
was able to find my flow eventually, but my explanation started with some
difficulty due to nerves. I can see improvements here, but my confidence hasn't
yet improved fully in the classroom.

**(2) Working with others:**   
I assisted Nick well in the class, creating materials on-the-fly to help out
with teaching and providing an explanation of the concept to students.

**(3) Organisation, reliability and self-management:**   
With little prior preparation, I was able to carry out a small part of the
lesson - I was able to quickly recap the topic from the resources I had brought
with me. Nick said that I had done a good job in explaining the topic, and was
able to continue the lesson with ease.

**(4) Initiative and creativity:**   
I took the initiative to develop a calculator for the questions the students
were answering. I suggested that the students could develop this too as a way of
testing their understanding of the concept.

**(5) Understanding the educational needs of others:**   
When explaining the concept of fixed-point binary numbers, I made sure to pace
myself and assess that the class were understanding the topic. First, I ensured
that they all understood each digit was mapped to a power of 2 in sequence.
Then, I ensured they understood how fixed-point binary numbers continued the
sequence through to the negatives, which represent fractions. I finished with an
example.

**(6) Use critical self-evaluation to identify three specific improvements you can make in the future:**

a)  I was able to prepare the fixed-point binary calculator on the fly.
However, it would be good to work with Nick in future to develop things like
this upfront and include them in the lesson plan. I should try to work more
closely with Nick on this. *Thus far, communication outside of visiting the
school has been an issue - I have been encouraged to send emails by both members
of staff but have received no response, making this difficult to act on.*

b)  Initially, I was overcome with nerves and rushed myself during the
explanation. I was able to recover from this quickly and deliver the explanation
as I had originally intended. In the future, I should be less daunted by this task.

c)  I may now be able to take on larger parts of lessons - not just ad-hoc, but
with some prior planning alongside Nick. I need to be more assertive in
expressing to him that I would like to do this.
