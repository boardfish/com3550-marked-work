# COM3550: Weekly Log Sheet

**Student Name:** Simon Fish

**Date:** 25-02-2020

**Action points identified from previous visit:** First major visit

**Tutoring context and session content:**

- Was in from 9-11.30.
- Observed and helped with a Y9 class, then a Y12 class â€“ the class that I intend to teach my special project to
- The Y9 class were learning about operating systems and bootloaders
- I showed the class the UEFI on my laptop as school systems were restricted, introducing them to the kinds of settings that the menu grants access to and the hardware-level functions UEFI controls, including changing which device to boot from
- The Y12 class were working on their special projects
- I tried to familiarise myself with some of the students and their projects, which included an Enigma machine replica and a flash card quiz. The students are given free rein to work on their projects in the hour
- Nick suggested that I draft a written proposal for my special project so that I can reach some level of detail with it in terms of timings

**Achievement and Progress:**   
*With reference to the Learning Criteria (1 to 6)
outlined in Section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have
taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the
methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or
need for improvement. Continue on a second sheet if required.*

**(1) Communication:**   
I was fairly comfortable with explaining the purpose of the UEFI off the cuff,
given that I had been handed control of the lesson at that point. I was less
comfortable approaching the students and asking about their personal projects.

**(2) Working with others:**   

During the Y9 lesson, I was able to interject and suggest showing the UEFI on my
laptop. This didn't distract from the lesson, was quick, and helped the students
by giving them a practical look at the topic. However, as mentioned, I found it
difficult to approach individual students during the Y12 lesson to ask them
about their projects. 

**(3) Organisation, reliability and self-management:**   
I made strides on this visit to push my special project forward. After having
been introduced to Nick by Maya, we discussed the special project and my current
progress towards making it a reality. He encouraged me to put together a more
complete package for my special project so that he could work it into the lesson
schedule.

**(4) Initiative and creativity:**   
I took the initiative to discuss the UEFI during the Y9 lesson. Using my own
laptop was a creative workaround for the security enforced by the school.

**(5) Understanding the educational needs of others:**   
I moved to discuss the UEFI because it would give a practical view of something
that was only previously taught through a lecture. I felt that this would
meet the educational needs of the class by demonstrating the subject to them
practically and moving the lesson further down the learning pyramid.

Nick explained that one student in the Y12 class was on the lower-functioning
end of the autistic spectrum. I was able to apply my own experience as someone
on the spectrum here - I approached and spoke to him in a manner that he would
welcome, hoping not to have distracted him from his work.

**(6) Use critical self-evaluation to identify three specific improvements you can make in the future:**

a)  Showing the UEFI to the students was a good practical spin on the
lesson. I discussed showing concepts in a similar way with Maya afterwards and
decided I should try to continue doing this, perhaps in more depth.

b)  I found it particularly difficult to be confident and comfortable around
the Y12 class. Given that they are the audience of my special project, I should
find ways to improve my relationship with the class.

c)  Last week, I understood that I needed to look into getting future lesson
plans from whichever teacher I am working with, and try to find a more concrete
role for myself in class. In order to feel more comfortable, particularly with
the Y12 class, I should talk to Nick about this.
