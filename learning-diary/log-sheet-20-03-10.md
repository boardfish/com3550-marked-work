# COM3550: Weekly Log Sheet

**Student Name:** Simon Fish

**Date:** 20-03-2020

**Action points identified from previous visit:**

- Bring full proposal to Nick to show properly   
  *Full proposal is almost ready*
- Make sure survey is complete   
  *Complete - just need ethics review*
- Get slides ready for special project lesson   
  *Done - will explain with those and then hand out the README - they're ordered
  a little differently*
- Show class GitHub links in open source lesson next time
- Investigate repl.it education license   
  *Repl.it has a free education license that allows for .5GHz CPU VMs on their
  platform for classes of up to 100, and automatic marking. If I can bootstrap
  the repo, it should be a good place to put the exercise. I'll ask Maya if
  she's willing to go ahead with that. Once I've got the instructions for
  repl.it in the README, I should be good to submit the ethics review.*

**Tutoring context and session content:**

Y12 class - systems software lesson - mostly types of application, closed/open source

I talked about this:

Open source software - most often hosted in Git repositories. Services like
GitHub, BitBucket, etc. allow users to host Git repositories. Some of these are
really major pieces of software, such as the majority of programming languages
in major use (Ruby, Python), and some are community projects and libraries such
as stympy/faker. OS has some good benefits like:

- lots of major software is open source - you might already use it. Examples
  include Inkscape, GIMP, and Visual Studio Code (see link)
- all users (and automated tools like Dependabot) being able to audit the code
  for vulnerabilities and fix it, often far sooner than closed source
- forks with improved features (airblader/i3)
- continued maintenance of software even after the creator gives up the mantle
  (rtv)

- vulnerable to [social engineering
  attacks](https://medium.com/hackernoon/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5)
- not as profitable as closed-source software, especially where enterprise is
  concerned (donations, foundations, etc. - enterprise supports open source in
  some cases)
- lots of open-source software is on GitHub, and many aren't willing to move off
  it despite changes in place (particularly as regards moral/ethical issues)
  since Microsoft bought it out

Y12 class, lesson on arrays and related data structures

I built a quick tested Python implementation of a queue to help the class
understand how they can interact with arrays (slicing, appending, reading from
an index etc.). I also built an implementation of Noughts and Crosses in Ruby,
which represented the board with a 2D array.

**Achievement and Progress:**   
*With reference to the Learning Criteria (1 to 6)
outlined in Section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have
taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the
methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or
need for improvement. Continue on a second sheet if required.*

**(1) Communication:**   
I was far more confident this time in explaining the concept of open source
software to the class. I was also able to work with Maya to provide links to the
class in this section. As I did not know the lesson plan for the second lesson,
I was able to quickly communicate with Nick to find a role for myself during the
lesson.

**(2) Working with others:**   
I worked well with Maya during the lesson to explain the world of open source,
and provided her with links that the class could browse to get a feel for what
goes on in the community. My work supported Nick in his explanation of queues
and array functions.

**(3) Organisation, reliability and self-management:**   
I was able to prepare the notes above in advance of the first lesson, having
spoken with Maya after my last visit. This enabled to be more confident and
clearer in my delivery of this part of the lesson.

**(4) Initiative and creativity:**   
My view of open source helped the students to get a practical look at the topic.
Many of my references (particularly `rtv` and `i3`) are inspired by software
that I've personally used. I also created resources for the second lesson.

**(5) Understanding the educational needs of others:**   
I felt that implementing a queue in Python would help the class to understand it
better, as it is a context that they are used to working in. The different
methods on `Queue` were readable one-line methods that summarise the actions one
can take with a queue succinctly.

**(6) Use critical self-evaluation to identify three specific improvements you can make in the future:**

a)  I'm happy with the strides I've made thus far to make a bigger impact in
lessons. I feel that at this point I should plan alongside Maya to run greater
parts of lessons using my own materials.
b)  I could better capitalise on what the Department of Computer Science has to
offer in order to make lessons more engaging, perhaps by encouraging competition
between students in the name of prizes.
c)  I gave the links to Maya during the lesson - while it didn't take too long,
she had to put them on the virtual learning environment in this time. This could
have been done before the lesson.
