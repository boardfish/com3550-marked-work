# COM3550: Weekly Log Sheet

**Student Name:** Simon Fish

**Date:** 20-01-2020

**Action points identified from previous visit:**

**Tutoring context and session content:**

- Was in from 9-11.30.
- Observed and helped with a Y7 class.
- Their exercises were to:
  - log in to SmoothWall
  - connect to their Sphero robot
  - draw a square with it by programming it to roll around in a set pattern using blocks
  - adapt their program to draw a triangle
  - ext: draw a maze on a sheet of paper and try to guide their Sphero around it - warmup for next lesson's task which uses a physical maze
- I could identify a few pairs that were really switched on, enjoying the task and satisfied with their own results
- I could also identify a few pairs that were regularly distracted and causing some mischief
- I assisted in some areas, particularly logging in to SmoothWall - noticed a couple of students didn't get the concept of a link to a website and instead had just searched "smoothwall login" - setting up the robot, and checking students' work
- It was really satisfying to see the students so impressed with their own work

**Achievement and Progress:**   
*With reference to the Learning Criteria (1 to 6)
outlined in Section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have
taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the
methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or
need for improvement. Continue on a second sheet if required.*

**(1) Communication:**   
I had context as to what the students were doing from the exercise sheet they
were given. I was also given free rein to wander the class and help out. This
helped me to approach pairs of students and assist them with anything that they
found difficult. I was able to explain things to them in a way they found easy
to understand, and solve most of their problems with signing in and connecting
the robots to the iPads.

**(2) Working with others:**   
I assisted Maya by helping the students during this lesson. I fell naturally
into this role.

**(3) Organisation, reliability and self-management:**   
I did not need to prepare any materials for the lesson itself. We discussed the
special project afterwards - I had sustained progress towards this over the
course of previous weeks.

**(4) Initiative and creativity:**   
Maya suggested that I observe this lesson, but I took the initiative to ask
about the context of the lesson, so that I could go around the class and help
out with the task.

**(5) Understanding the educational needs of others:**   
I understood that this was a younger class, so I tried to appear as helpful and
friendly to them as possible.

**(6) Use critical self-evaluation to identify three specific improvements you
can make in the future:**

a)  I did not arrive knowing which lesson I would be assisting with. I
should make a point of asking about the context of my next visit so that I can
do more to prepare.

b)  I did not feel incredibly confident during the lesson. I should try to
feel more at ease in these situations.

c)  My role in the class was not concrete - I had to assert it for myself. I
spoke to Maya after the lesson to try and get some idea of what next week's
session would be like upfront. I should continue to work with Maya to find a
role for myself in each lesson, and seek to understand future lesson plans in preparation.
